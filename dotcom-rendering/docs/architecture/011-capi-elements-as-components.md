# Static types

## Context

CAPI provides a representation of content which is strongly typed and like components.

### CAPI Elements as Components

The CAPI Blocks API exposes a suite of strongly typed elements. A component should be made for each element to render it.

### Functionality

A component may take an element, as typed in CAPI and render it.

A component may take an element, which has been optimised for display by frontend, and display that.

_I'm not suggesting both, this should be updated._
