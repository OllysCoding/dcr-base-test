# To Adopt the Lightweight Architectural Design Decision Format

## Context

This project is growing to the size and maturity where documenting the decisions made in it's creation will be strongly beneficial.

The convention of lightweight architectural decisions [is set out by think relevance](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). It is set out in the form of an architectural decision record.

## Decision

For all architectural decisions in this project, an architectural decision record will be created with a filename of `XXX-decision-title.md` where XXX is the monotonically increasing number described in the linked document.

## Status

Proposed
